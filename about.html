      <h1>Who am I?</h1>

      <p>I'm Natalia, I was born in Colombia and since I was little I love creating things with my hands, they are my
        best tools to materialize my ideas. I enjoy building with different materials, I love painting, woodworking,
        creating my jewelry, knitting and designing real and digital products</p>

      <p>I am an empathetic person who enjoys putting myself in other people's shoes and seeing things from different
        perspectives. I have always had a passion for learning, whether it involves acquiring new skills, exploring
        hobbies, or studying languages. Currently, I am in my second year of the Interaction Design program at George
        Brown College (GBC), where I have gained extensive knowledge about virtual platform design. This program builds
        on my previous education as a Product Design Engineer at Eafit University in Colombia. I am proficient in
        various software applications, including Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Maya, 3D Studio Max, Substance 3D
        Painter, Creo CAD, Microsoft Office, Figma, Miro, Visual Studio Code, and more.</p>
